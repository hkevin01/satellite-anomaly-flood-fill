# Satellite Anomaly Flood-Fill Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Satellite Onboard Anomaly Isolation system** using flood-fill algorithms on fault maps. The system is designed for space systems fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) with real-time constraints.

### Problem Statement
Small satellites and deep-space probes need to quickly isolate contiguous regions of anomalies on 2D/3D grids (e.g., solar array surfaces, radiator panels, star tracker sensor planes) to trigger containment actions, adjust attitude, or reconfigure routing systems.

### Solution Approach
Use flood-fill algorithms to detect connected anomaly "blobs" and calculate region properties (area, centroid, perimeter, bounding box), then feed those into a decision layer for GN&C (Guidance, Navigation, and Control) or FDIR actions.
